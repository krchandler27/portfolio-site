        <article>
            <p class="info"> Hello! My name is Katie Speakman and I am native to Charleston, South Carolina. I went to school at
                Brigham Yound University in Provo, Utah and graduated in 2015. I majored in Math Education and I taught
                school
                at Highland High in Gilbert, Arizona for three years after graduating college. I took a step back from
                teaching to have two beautiful
                children Cooper Joe and Rosalee May. I am now an experienced coder and have designed my websites and
                applications. I can and will design you the website or application of your
                dreams. Click here to get in contact with me. See below for links to my work. I look forward to hearing
                from you and speaking with you about the website or application of your dreams!

                -Katie &#10084;
