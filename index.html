            <p class="info"> Hello! My name is Katie Speakman and I am native to Charleston, South Carolina. I went to
                school at
                Brigham Yound University in Provo, Utah and graduated in 2015. I majored in Math Education and was a
                math teacher for three years
                at Highland High in Gilbert, Arizona. I took a step back from
                teaching to have two beautiful
                children Cooper Joe and Rosalee May. I am now an experienced coder and have designed many websites and
                applications. I can and will design you the website or application of your
                dreams. Click here to get in contact with me. Click on the links below to see some of my work. I look
                forward to hearing
                from you and speaking with you about designing the website or application of your dreams!

                -Katie &#10084;
